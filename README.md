# TechInterviewTask
Project related to technical interview. April 2023.

Forgot to use GitHub from start. This was a mistake.

Whole project is coded in PyCharm with Python 3.11 venv interpreter.


-- Thoughts on improvements --

- Format GUI list to look cleaner and more structured.

- Consider opting for web app for better accessibility.

- Decouple GUI from database, maybe add an API layer in between
  + Security
  + Scalability
  + Independent maintencance and/or further development

- Limit data retrieval to 1000 first entries. 
  - Avoid duplicate entries if reload of data.

- Future implementation of ranking function.
